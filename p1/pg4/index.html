    <h2>Diet and habitat</h2>
    <p>Lamas are grass eaters and browse for native grasses, low shrubs and mountain vegetation. They are able to obtain water from the food they consume, but they also need a source of fresh water for survival.</p>
    <p>Llamas are considered ruminants even though they only have a three-compartment stomach versus a four-compartment stomach. They regurgitate their food intake after it is partially digested in the rumen, the llamas first stomach.  The partially-digested food is called cud, which is chewed again to aid in the digestive process before it is can be fully <a href="../pg5/index.html">digested.</a></p>
