    <h2>General Description</h2>
    <p>Llamas are graceful creatures with large eyes and a gentle character.  They are easy to handle when well socialized to humans and their environment. Social by nature, llamas interact in herds and when removed from their herd will bond with other livestock such as sheep.

    <p>They are remarkably sure footed on a variety of terrain because of their unique adapted feet. Their feet are two toed with a broad, leathery pad on the bottom.  Llamas have nails, not hoofs.  Their feet are low-impact on the environment.</p>

    <p>Llamas have scent glands on the lower, outside of the rear legs and between the toes.  The metatarsal scent glands are suspected to be an alarm mechanism, but the purpose is not well understood.  The gland may also help in regulating the body temperature. There is another gland on the inner surface of the rear leg and it is called the tarsal gland and it is how llamas identify individuals within the herd.</p>

    <p>Another interesting fact about llamas is that they have a high content of hemoglobin in their bloodstream and the shape of their red blood cells is oval and not circular. These characteristics are adaptations which contribute to the llama's ability to adapt and live in an oxygen-poor, high altitude <a href="../pg2/index.html">environment.</a></p>
