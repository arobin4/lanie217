    <h2>Llamas Body</h2>
    <p>The llamas hair also helps them easily adapt to a variety of environments. The texture of a llamaâ€™s coat varies.  Some have coarser guard hairs on the outer layer and a softer type of wool on the undercoat.  A llamas thick coat can help them withstand the cold, wind, snow and rain.  Short hair found in other areas of the llamas body help dissipate heat when placed in warmer environments.
