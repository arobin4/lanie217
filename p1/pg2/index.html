    <h2>General Description</h2>
    <p>The llama's hair also helps them easily adapt to a variety of environments. The texture of a llama’s coat varies.  Some have coarser guard hairs on the outer layer and a softer type of wool on the undercoat.  A llama’s thick coat can help them withstand the cold, wind, snow and rain.  Short hair found in other areas of the llama’s body help dissipate heat when placed in warmer environments.
