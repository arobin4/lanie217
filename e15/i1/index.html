    <h2>Instructions for picture</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Create a 8.5 by 11 inch document in Illustrator</li>
    <li> This picture will have no color, so it will just be black and white</li>
    <li> the overall shape should be drawn in the center slightly on the left side and slighty towards the top</li>
    <li> Go to the curvature pen tool and create a oval-circle shape as you see from the reference</li>
    <li> Once you have the basic shape, you are going to use the curvature tool again to create a curved line inside of the shape you just made.</li>
    <li> Once you have made that curved line then you are going to duplicate that line 2 times</li>
    <li> You are then going to use the curvature tool again to create a curved line on the opposite end inside the shape</li>
    <li> You will then duplicate that curved line 1 time</li>
    <li> There should be space between the lines inside the shape, be aware of that</li>
    </ul>
